#### Do I have to send transactions to blockchain to sign or verify signatures? And do I need ETH to pay for gas? 

No. Singing and signature check is made in your browser. 

Information about key owner read from blockchain, without sending transactions. So you do not need ETH do use this application.

#### How else can you use verified EHT accounts/keys except for digital signatures?

They can be used in smart contracts and for verification on distributed application.
